I can only run distances, barefoot-style.

**my running creed**
```
<center>running is not a sport or a fasion;</center>
it's endurance.
i run when i'm tired,
i run when i'm sleepy,
i run when the weather is hot,
i run when the weather is wet,
i run when i don't want to,
i run when others don't want to,
i run when it's uncomfortable,
i run when i have to endure.
running is endurance;
it's not a sport or a fashion.
```

**time-based running**

These are my numbers for the different distance running I have done so far: **_232951182030452500_**. I am pretty pleased with them though there are times I want to better them.

Yet, I know my ultimate running goal is to do a 50-mile run, so speed is no longer a concern. In fact, last week, I started doing time-based running which I believe will train me effectively for an ultra-run. I want to **run far and long**.

**move your body**

Do yourself a favour; don't follow the herds.

1. Take the stairs for shorter distances, even if escalators or elevators are available.
2. Stand, not sit, while you are on the MRT train.
3. Brisk walk or run for 45 minutes per session.
